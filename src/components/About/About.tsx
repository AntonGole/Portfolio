          <p>
            I am a dedicated backend developer with a robust background in
            Computer Science and Engineering. My career has so far taken me
            through large-scale corporate environments, notably at Ericsson,
            where I developed innovative tools for visualizing traffic model
            simulations and improving testing processes by identifying and
            eliminating redundant tests.

          <p>
            Currently, Iâ€™m working on my Master thesis at Volvo Cars, where I am
            investigating the impact of simulation fidelity on automotive
            decision-making systems. For this thesis, I program mainly using C++
            and Unreal Engine to create high-fidelity simulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career at both Ericsson and Volvo, I have gained
            extensive experience working within Linux environments and using Git
            for efficient version control and collaboration.
